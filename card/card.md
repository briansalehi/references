# Section name

Any text between section name and headline will be ignored.

## Headline of the card in question format?

Body of the card in paragraphs or blocks of code.

```js
console.log('Sample of a block code')
```

Always specify the language of code blocks for syntax highlighing.

Each card can have as many paragraphs or code blocks as you want.

Try to avoid falling in the loop of writing headlines with How To questions. Instead, expose the answer details inside the headline so that by reading them you get the idea of what the answer could be. This will help you review cards faster without actually reading the entire body of your cards.
